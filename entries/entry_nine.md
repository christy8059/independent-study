# Finalizing the Product

This week was the time to develop my MVP and make it fabulous. Since I was unable to deploy my MVP to a server I decided to make an app. The app has a model, view, and controller in order to interact with the user. The code from my MVP was the base of the app. It guided me to the direct I wanted. I wanted the bot to do more than just looking for a hashtag and retweeting it. Yes, I thought it was cool but I also wanted to input other functions as well. Therefore, the app is a great way to present that. 

Building the app was challenging because I shifted gear from Sinatra to learning ruby bot. I honestly would say that I forgot how to make an app. I went back to the lessons and ask a classmate for their help. After encountering a couple of obstacles I was able to create this simple but working app. 

Here is the link to my [app](http://final-twitter-app.herokuapp.com/).

Although I made the app, there was still an error that I can't figure out. When you choose the retweet timer the result page does not appear. Instead, it says there is an error. I checked the Heroku log but nothing gave me a clue to why it does not work. As shown in the previous entry the method does work and is an effective way to retweet. This is dont by using the rufus-scheduler. Also it can be used to also tweet, like posts, direct message and etc. 

# Presentation
Although the product is done, the project is still incomplete. For presentation, I created slides to reflect and share what I have learned in the past 8 weeks. This can be challenging since we've learned so much. I chose the important things to point out to my classmates. 

1. What the product is/ What is it for. 
2. How I got to the idea. 
3. The major component to make the product.  
4. The type of function it can do
5. And the result of the project.


Throughout this independent lesson, I learned a lot. I learned to be independent on learning and figuring out the problems that occurred. This unit was like a pre-transition lesson because when I'm in college I'll have to do the same thing. I won't have a lot of resources to help me besides the internet. This is because someone has gone through the same situation as me before while learning about Twitter. Therefore issues that I have encountered or will encounter will surely be on the internet.  


# Takeaways 
- I learned that coding can be stressful but at the same time it can be joyful. After encountering many problems I realized how amazing it feels to get through an obstacle but just simply googling the problem. 
- Look back at class notes for things that you forgot
- Take breaks before going back to work
